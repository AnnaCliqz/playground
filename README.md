# Cliqz Hackday - November 2015
A Github to Powerpoint Generator

## A Problem...

| Engrs | Non-Engrs. |
| ---- | ----- |
| 'Like' to use Github | 'Have' to use Github |    
| 'Have' to use powerpoint | 'Like' to use powerpoint |    

## Both have pluses and minuses...

- Github is good for version control, maintaining history and collaboration
- Powerpoint is nice and easy to use


## Bring the best of both worlds together...
For this hack day we developed a tool that converts the github read me file into powerpoint... and vice versa.

# Time for a Quick Demo

## Questions???
